  <h2>Hello, my name is Pesho and here you can read more about me</h2>
</div>
<div class="pg-page-main">
  <div class="pg-page-text">
    <p>Programmer wannabe.
      All my professional experience so far involves communication with people. My main qualities are that I am always
      pretty straight forward and honest, with great ability to make and receive constructive criticism. Currently I am
      dedicating my free time to study Front-End Web Development (JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node js , React,etc.). In order
      to achieve this I am participating in the ongoing Programming courses in SoftUni. The good thing is that I am able
      find balance between working and studying without any of them hindering the other. I will be looking forward for
      new
      opportunities as an intern or junior front end developer in the near future.</p>

      My spare time goes for my hobbies, one of which is gaming, mainly from the Blizzard universe with most played game
      being the MMORPG World of Warcraft and others like Hearthstone, Diablo, Overwatch, Starcraft, Heroes of the Storm,
      but I also like games such as TFT(Teamfight Tactics) Leage of Legends, Battlefield and others.
      Other activities that I really enjoy is visiting new places with my friends such as Rilla's Monastery, Hisarlaka -
      park in Kyustendil , Tepeto in Plovdiv and many more. Along that I enjoy taking photos of the surroundings and my
      friends.
